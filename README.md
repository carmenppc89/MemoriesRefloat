# Memories Refloat

## What is it?
Memories Reafloat is the rekindling of my final degree project. A 2D Unity project about a fisherman paying his debt by catching and selling fish and mollusks.
Everything in this project is made by hand and always will be.

## Why now?
The way my team and I ended this project has always rubbed me the wrong way. Now I have the chance to make it itch less.
